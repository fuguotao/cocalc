# Snippets Dialog
# This is a modal dialog, which downloads a hierarchical collection of code snippets
# with descriptions. It returns an object, containing the code and the language:
# {"code": "...", "lang" : "..."} via a given callback.
#
# The canonical project creating the appropriate datastructure is
# https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc-assistant
#
# Usage:
# w = render_snippets_dialog(target, project_id, filename, lang)
#     * target: jquery dom object, where react is put into
#     * project_id and filename to make state in redux unique
#     * lang is the mode (sage, r, python, ...)
# use 'w.set_handler' to set the handler that's used for inserting the selected document
# API (implemented in SnippetsActions)
# w.show([lang]) -- show dialog again (same state!) and in csae a language given, a selection of it is triggered
